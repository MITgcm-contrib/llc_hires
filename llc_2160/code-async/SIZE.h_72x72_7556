  The somewhat weird looking format of this file is so that it can be
  included in both C and FORTRAN routines.  The general problem is that
  FORTRAN requires that the definitions in this header file be included
  in each *subroutine*, and thus possibly multiple times in a single
  source file if that source file defines multiple subroutines, while C
  demands that the actual definitions only appear once per *file*, even
  if this header file is (accidently) #include'd multiple times.

  N.B.: Do NOT remove the parentheses in the "enum" or "PARAMETER"
  declarations.  We want the user to be able to use an expression
  in the "#define" (e.g. "#define __sNx    64 + 8 "), and not have
  to worry about precedence in the substituted expressions (e.g.
  if "__sNx" is defined as 64 + 8, then "__sNx * __sNy" would not
  behave the way you might expect, unlike "(__sNx) * (__sNy)").

  Define the magic constants.  If you want to add (or delete) entries,
  note that the change needs to also be made to the C "enum" and the
  Fortran "parameter" statements.

    __sFacet : The fundamental unit size of a facet in llc.  Facets
               one and two are 1unit x 3units, facet three (the arctic
               polar facet) is 1unit x 1unit, and facets four and five
               are 3units x 1unit.

    __sNx, __sNy : The (sub)tile dimensions.  Each must divide __sFacet.
                   Note that if sub-tiles are being used (i.e. __nSx
                   and/or __nSy are greater than one), these dimensions
                   are the extent of each sub-tile.

    __OLx, __OLy : The overlap, i.e. the number of ghost cells.

    __nSx, __nSy : If the code uses parallel threads in (addition to MPI),
                   the sub-division of an individual tile into sub-tiles.
                   An MPI process is assigned a whole tile, and each thread
                   within that process is assigned a sub-tile.  Thus, each
                   MPI process will use (__nSx * __nSy) threads.  These
                   values are usually both "1" (i.e. no threading).

    __nPx, __nPy : The full llc decomposition of the earth contains
                     (__sFacet/__sNx) * (__sFacet/__sNy) * 13
                   total tiles.  However, some of these tiles represent
                   areas that have no water, and so MITgcm doesn't care
                   about them. (These are called "dry" tiles, or "blank"
                   tiles.)  We take that sub-set of the tiles we care
                   about (i.e. the "wet" tiles; the ones we are actually
                   going to do computations on), and imagine those tiles
                   being in a 2D array, with extent (__nPx, __nPy).
                   As a practical matter, for the llc decomposition,
                   __nPy is almost always 1 (and __nPx is equal to the
                   number of "wet" tiles).

    __Nr : The number of vertical levels in the 3D fields.
