C   pkg/exf CPP options:
C   --------------------
C
C   > ( EXF_VERBOSE ) < replaced with run-time, logical parameter "exf_verbose".
C
C   >>> ALLOW_ATM_WIND <<<
C       If defined, 10-m wind fields can be read-in from files.
C
C   >>> ALLOW_ATM_TEMP <<<
C       If defined, atmospheric temperature and specific
C       humidity fields can be read-in from files.
C
C   >>> ALLOW_DOWNWARD_RADIATION <<<

C       can be read-in form files or computed from lwflux and swflux.
C
C   >>> ALLOW_ZENITHANGLE <<<

C       incoming fluxes at the top of the atmosphere are computed
C
C   >>> ALLOW_BULKFORMULAE <<<

C       turbulent and radiative fluxes at the ocean surface.
C
C   >>> EXF_READ_EVAP <<<

C       If defined, seaice fraction can be read-in from files (areaMaskFile)
C
C   >>> ALLOW_CLIMSST_RELAXATION <<<
C       Allow the relaxation to a monthly climatology of sea surface
C       temperature, e.g. the Reynolds climatology.
C
C   >>> ALLOW_CLIMSSS_RELAXATION <<<
C       Allow the relaxation to a monthly climatology of sea surface
C       salinity, e.g. the Levitus climatology.

C
C   ====================================================================
C
C       The following CPP options:
C
C          ALLOW_ATM_WIND              (WIND)
C          ALLOW_ATM_TEMP              (TEMP)
C          ALLOW_DOWNWARD_RADIATION    (DOWN)
C          ALLOW_BULKFORMULAE          (BULK)
C          EXF_READ_EVAP               (EVAP)
C
C       permit the ocean-model forcing configurations listed in the
C       table below.  The first configuration is the default,
C       flux-forced, ocean model.  The next four are stand-alone
C       configurations that use pkg/exf, open-water bulk formulae to
C       compute the missing surface fluxes from atmospheric variables.
C       The last four configurations can be used in conjunction with
C       pkg/seaice to model ice-covered regions.  The forcing fields
C       in the rightmost column are defined in exf_fields.

C   before any other operation is done (e.g. rescaling) with
