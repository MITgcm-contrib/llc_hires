1. For all runs starting with "rt", the forcing files will have to be linked from /home/p/peltier/dmenemen/project/ECMWF_operational/.
Runtime parameter file template can be found in /home/p/peltier/dmenemen/project/Box56/run_template/ and /home/p/peltier/dmenemen/project/Box56/input/

2. For vertical layers higher than the original global run (88 layers), new boundary and intial condition files will have to be made by some
appropriate interpolation algorithm. They only exists as soft links here

3. The build options file (specific to Scinet/Niagara (Toronto) supercomputer) can be used from the run "rt_120_equi_back_off"
and can be run as described in the readme.txt file in "2k_88l/"

4. Check readme of "2k_88l/code/" on where to change the KPP package related files
